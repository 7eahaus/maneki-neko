# Welcome
Welcome to the Maneki-Neko theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). This is a learning experience and theme that will (hopefully) someday be on the Obsidian theme gallery.
This theme was made with love to invoke the image of *maneki-neko*, Japanese lucky cat statues. These statues are often found in the entrances of businesses to bring good fortune and luck to the business. They often have a beconing paw raised, inviting prospective customers in to take a look at the business.
